Installation
============

First, make sure that you have Ruby (>= version 1.8) installed. You can do this
by typing `ruby --version` in the command line.

 - For Mac users, there's no need to do anything. Ruby comes with the OS by default.
 - For Windows users, I don't know.
 - For Ubuntu users, `sudo apt-get install ruby`.

Install Hyde by typing:

    gem install hydeweb

If this process fails, you can instead try `sudo gem install hydeweb`.
